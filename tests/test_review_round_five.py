"""The fifth review round, and the fourth distinct door onto one property.

Round three's commit message said, of "a partial observation is not an observation": *there
will be a fourth*. There was. `_children()` returned `None` when `/proc` could not be listed —
and then silently skipped every individual `stat` that failed, so a `hidepid=2` boundary
produced a partial process tree, `claude_under` reported no Claude for panes it was refused
sight of, and `sweep` deleted those live records.

The discrimination that fixes it is worth the precision: `ENOENT` means the process exited
between the listdir and the open, which happens constantly on a busy box and is genuinely
absent; `EACCES`/`EPERM` means we were refused, which is unknown. Treating them alike in either
direction is wrong — one way makes the tree permanently unreadable, the other deletes live
sessions.
