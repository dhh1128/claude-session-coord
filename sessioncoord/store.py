"""Where coordination state lives: `~/.local/state/claude-coord/<repo-key>/`.

Not in the repo. Daniel picked this on 2026-09-17 and the reasons are worth keeping: a session
touches several repos, so per-repo state under `.ignored/` fragments the very thing that has to
be global; `.ignored/` multiplies once per worktree and dies when the worktree is removed,
taking the record of who was working there with it; and one state root answers "who is where
across the estate" with a single scan instead of a walk of ~50 repos.

One file per session rather than one file per repo, deliberately: several sessions register
concurrently and a shared file would need locking. Separate files make concurrent writes
non-interfering without any lock at all, which is also why `flock` turned out to be the wrong
primitive for presence -- a lock nobody blocks on is just a file, and the Bash tool spawns a
fresh shell per call so nothing can hold one across a turn anyway.

The ask queue is the exception and does need a lock, because it is one shared list that every
session read-modifies-writes. `cli` takes `locks.hold(repo, "asks")` around the whole
load/transform/save, not just the write -- an atomic rename stops a torn read, it does not make
a read-modify-write transaction atomic. Both PR #3 reviewers caught that independently.

This is an adapter: one of the three modules that touches the world.
