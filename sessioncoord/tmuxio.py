"""Where sessions live, and how one speaks to another.

The pane -> claude-pid map is the liveness substrate. `claude_under` walks descendants of the
pane's shell rather than trusting `#{pane_current_command}`, because a session mid tool-call has
a bash child in the foreground and would otherwise read as a plain shell -- the same reasoning,
and the same walk, as `tmux-claude`.

Two rules here came out of the PR #3 review and both are load-bearing.

**A failed tmux call returns None, never "".** Every consumer distinguishes "could not look"
from "looked and found nothing", because collapsing them let a transient tmux failure erase a
repo's entire presence registry.

**`send` is hostile input by construction.** It types text into a terminal somebody else is
using, so the message is filtered for control bytes and sent with `send-keys -l`. Without `-l`,
tmux parses key NAMES: a message containing the word `Enter` submits the recipient's
half-written prompt, and one containing `C-c` interrupts their work. That is not a hypothetical
-- it is the default behaviour of the command.

`send` is the capability Daniel authorised on 2026-09-17: one session types into another's
prompt, which is the mechanical form of him carrying a prompt to three windows by hand. It is
also the most alarming thing in this package, which is why it refuses more than it accepts.

    into a prompt, so inter-session PROSE was impossible until the body moved to a file.

    Guards, because this is a session acting on Daniel's behalf without him watching:

    * The message is rejected outright if it carries control bytes (see `_clean`).
    * The target must currently hold a live Claude session. Typing into a shell would EXECUTE
      the message.
    * `expect_pid`, when given, must be the claude process in that pane -- so a caller holding
      a presence record talks to the session it meant rather than to whoever inherited the
      pane id. Pane ids are reused.
    * The pane is re-checked immediately before the keystrokes go out. This narrows the
      window between check and send; it cannot close it, because tmux offers no atomic
      send-if-still-this-process. A caller that must not be wrong should pass `expect_pid`.
    * Text goes out with `-l` (literal). Without it tmux parses key names, and a message
      mentioning `Enter` or `C-c` would submit or interrupt the recipient's work.
    * Both tmux calls are checked. Reporting "sent" after a failed send is worse than an
      error, because the sender then believes the peer was told.
