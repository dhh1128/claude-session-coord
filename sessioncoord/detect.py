"""What the board notices about a set of live sessions in one repo.

Every detector traces to a cost paid on 2026-09-17 in `acme/infra`. Each one carries its
incident in a comment, so a future reader can tell an observed hazard from an imagined one --
and can retire a detector honestly if the hazard stops being real.

The hardest constraint is not what these fire on but what they stay silent about. One session
alone in a repo is almost every session, and it must produce exactly nothing: a board that
speaks in the common case gets muted, and a muted board protects nobody.

Pure. Everything comes in on the `Board`; nothing here shells out.
