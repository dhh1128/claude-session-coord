"""How often a session may interrupt another one, and whether it wants an answer.

The inbox in `inbox.py` gives a message somewhere to go. This module governs whether it should
have been sent at all.

Daniel, 2026-09-18, after watching two sessions message each other for an hour while he could
not get a word in: *"chatty responses that provoke navel-gazing and self-reinforcing sycophancy
is a waste of my time and token budget... It's kind of like teaching the AIs to treat my
attention as a precious resource."*

THE EVIDENCE. One session relayed a withdrawal to another that had already been given to Daniel
directly. The second messaged back to stop the relay, arriving after it was sent. Both then
narrated the exchange to him. Four turns of his attention, no decision changed anywhere.

THE REASON A RULE WILL NOT FIX IT. Both sessions diagnosed the problem *in the same breath as
committing it* -- one wrote, in its own pane, "Each relay was defensible on its own; the
aggregate is precisely the attention-spend the whole apparatus exists to stop." Self-awareness
is not the missing ingredient. A rule phrased "ask whether this is necessary" gets a sincere
yes every time, because each individual message genuinely is defensible. That is the same shape
as this tool's own ask queue, documented and used zero times across twelve repos until
something enforced it. So: mechanism over exhortation, and a budget that bites.

WHAT THE BUDGET IS PRICED AGAINST, now that the inbox exists. Filing a message costs the
recipient nothing until it looks. Typing into its prompt makes it spend a turn reading and
usually another replying, and both sessions then narrate the exchange to Daniel. So the thing
being rationed is not "telling a peer something" -- it is *interrupting* one, which is a much
narrower claim.

Pure. Persistence is `store`'s job.
