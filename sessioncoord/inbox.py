"""A durable queue of messages between sessions, and a doorbell that says one has arrived.

Daniel's design, 2026-09-18. Typing a whole message into a peer's prompt has three problems
that got worse the more of it we did:

* It lands mid-sentence. His own half-typed message was submitted along with a peer's, arriving
  as one turn he could not attribute -- and the submission, not the garbling, is the real harm.
* It cannot carry prose. `tmuxio._clean` refuses control characters in anything typed, so a
  multi-line message was impossible until the body moved to a file.
* A busy peer is unreachable. The busy-prompt guard correctly refuses to type over somebody
  mid-sentence, and then there is nowhere to put the message. Three retries to one peer failed
  in a row while the thing that needed saying sat in a file nobody was told about.

So the body goes in a queue the recipient owns, and the only thing typed is a constant, short
doorbell. The recipient drains at its own pace, N pending messages collapse into one signal, and
nothing is ever blocked on the state of someone's prompt.

The doorbell is a RUNNABLE COMMAND rather than a bare sigil, which is the one place this departs
from the original sketch. The thing receiving it is a language model reading its own prompt, not
a parser: a bare mark needs a decoder and would be met with "what does this mean?", routed
straight back to Daniel. `>>> session-coord inbox` needs no convention, and any session can act
on it whether or not it has ever loaded the skill.

Pure over the queue; `store` owns the files.

    Rings on their FIRST unread -- and again when the oldest unread has been waiting past
    `RING_AGAIN_AFTER_SECONDS`, which is the correction.

    The original rule was "ring only on the first unread", reasoning that a peer with mail
    waiting has already been told and a second ring only spends another keystroke. That
    reasoning silently bound "has been told" to "has unread mail", and the two stopped being
    the same thing the moment a peer did not drain its inbox.

    They did not. Within two hours two peers had accumulated three and six unread messages and
    read none; one of them then re-proposed a diagnosis that my refutation, sitting unread in
    its inbox, had already answered. Nine messages were filed, one doorbell was rung, and the
    channel had gone quiet without anyone noticing -- including me, who wrote it.

    This is the stale-claim family in the thing built to coordinate around it: a claim true once
    ("they have been told") reused after it stopped being true. The remedy here is the weakest
    of the three -- make staleness detectable by giving the claim a lifetime -- because the
    stronger ones are not available: nothing in this tool can make a peer read.
